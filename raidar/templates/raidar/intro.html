<h2>What is is GW2 Raidar?</h2>

<p>With the advent and increased usage of DPS meters in <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/">Guild Wars 2</a> Raid scene, there have been a number of different parsers released to analyse, in detail, combat statistics and logs for post review.</p>

<p>While being able to assist in post encounter analysis is great, current lack one thing, context. GW2 Raidar’s approach to log parsing is slightly different. By retaining high level data about uploaded encounters, GW2 Raidar will allow you compare your individual and squad performance against everyone else’s as an average which will allow you to further analyse your post fight logs.</p>

<p>With GW2 Raidar you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>See at a top level your performance and your squad’s performance at a glance</li>
  <li>See how your and your squads metrics compare to current averages</li>
  <li>See what the top group metrics and what professions are most popular for each encounter</li>
  <li>Upload 1 log per encounter and have everyone in the squad access the encounter automatically via their GW2 Raidar account</li>
  <li>Link multiple Guild Wars 2 accounts to a single GW2 Raidar account for a consolidated single view across all your raid characters</li>
  <li>See your personal raid statistics as a whole</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Getting started is easy. Simply create a new account on the website. You will need to provide in addition to your desired login credentials, your Guild Wars 2 API Key to confirm your ownership of a Guild Wars 2 Account.</p>

<p>GW2 Raidar will automatically get your Guild Wars 2 account name and any already uploaded encounters that feature your Guild Wars 2 account will show up straight away in your encounters page.</p>

<h2>Uploading Logs</h2>

<p>To upload your logs, simply drag and drop your <a target="arcdps" href="https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/">arcdps</a> log files into the browser window. GW2 Raidar supports both uncompressed (<code>.evtc</code>) and compressed (<code>.evtc.zip</code>) logs. Your logs should appear in the Encounters page after they have been processed. You can access each encounters' data by clicking on the desired row.</p>

<h2>THE NUMBERS MASON! WHAT DO THEY MEAN?</h2>

<p>On each Encounter page, you’ll be shown a few different sections of statistics as per below. For all statistics (with the exception of Party stats), the following colour codes apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Red to yellow to green: Visually compares your figure with global average. Red = Worse than average, Yellow = On par, Green = Better than average</li>
  <li>Purple: Visually represent the current average</li>
</ul>

<h3>Squad</h3>

<img src="{% static 'raidar/img/intro/squad.png' %}"/>
<p>Shows total squad values. The first number denotes your squad’s totals with the second number denoting the current global average</p>

<h3>Party</h3>

<img src="{% static 'raidar/img/intro/party.png' %}"/>
<p>Allows you compare individual party information to see performance of each sub group. These have no averages. </p>

<h3>Individual</h3>

<img src="{% static 'raidar/img/intro/individual.png' %}"/>
<p>Shows individual values. The first number denotes individual values with the second number denoting the current global average. All averages are based on the detected archetype e.g. a Support Druid will have different averages compared to a Condi Druid.</p>

<p>Individual archetypes are denoted by the icon to the left of the profession icon.</p>
